# Klack, a stack based array langauge
### Quickstart
run `make`
and start the repl with `./repl`
### About
Klack takes a lot of inspiration from the stack based language FORTH, but with some added features from an array langauge such as K or APL. It uses RPN (reverse polish notation), just like in forth. An example: (2+2)*4 using RPN would be 2 2 + 4 *.
